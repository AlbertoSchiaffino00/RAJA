<h2>Gitflow Branching Model<a class="headerlink" href="#gitflow-branching-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The RAJA project uses a simple branch development model based on
<a class="reference external" href="https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html">Gitflow</a>.
The Gitflow model is centered around software releases. It is a simple
workflow that makes clear which branches correspond to which phases of
development. Those phases are represented explicitly in the branch names and
structure of the repository. As in other branching models, developers develop
code on a local branch and push their work to a central repository.</p>
<section id="persistent-protected-branches">
<h3>Persistent, Protected Branches<a class="headerlink" href="#persistent-protected-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>main</strong> and <strong>develop</strong> branches are the two primary branches we use.
They always exist and are protected in the RAJA GitHub project, meaning that
changes to them can only occur as a result of approved pull requests. The
distinction between the main and develop branches is an important part of
Gitflow.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <em>main</em> branch records the release history of the project. Each time
the main branch is changed, a new tag for a new code version is made.
See <a class="reference internal" href="versioning.html#version-label"><span class="std std-ref">RAJA Release Version Naming</span></a> for a description of the version labeling scheme
we use.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>develop</em> branch is used to integrate and test new features and most
bug fixes before they are merged into the main branch for a release.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p><strong>Development never occurs directly on the main branch or
develop branch.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>All other branches are temporary and are used to perform specific development
tasks. When such a branch is no longer needed (e.g., after it is merged), the
branch is deleted typically.</p>
</section>
<section id="feature-branches">
<h3>Feature Branches<a class="headerlink" href="#feature-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <em>feature</em> branch is created from another branch (usually develop) and is
used to develop new features, bug fixes, etc. before they are merged to develop
and eventually main. <em>Feature branches are temporary</em>, living only as long as
they are needed to complete development tasks they contain.</p>
<p>Each new feature, or other well-defined portion of work, is developed on its
own feature branch. We typically include a label, such as  “feature” or
“bugfix”, in a feature branch name to make it clear what type of work is being
done on the branch. For example, <strong>feature/&lt;name-of-feature&gt;</strong> for a new
feature, <strong>bugfix/&lt;issue&gt;</strong> for a bugfix, etc.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>When doing development on a feature branch, it is good practice
to regularly push your changes to the GitHub repository
as a backup mechanism. Also, regularly merge the RAJA develop
branch into your feature branch so that it does not diverge
too much from other development on the project. This will help
reduce merge conflicts that you must resolve when your work is
ready to be merged into the RAJA develop branch.</p>
</div>
<p>When a portion of development is complete and ready to be merged into the
develop branch, submit a <em>pull request</em> (PR) for review by other team members.
When all issues and comments arising in PR review discussion have been
addressed, the PR has been approved, and all continuous integration checks
have passed, the pull request can be merged.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p><strong>Feature branches almost never interact directly with the main
branch.</strong> One exception is when a bug fix is needed in
the main branch to tag a patch release.</p>

<h3>Other Important Branches<a class="headerlink" href="#other-important-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Release candidate</strong> and <strong>hotfix</strong> branches are two other important
temporary branch types in Gitflow. They will be explained in the
<a class="reference internal" href="release_process.html#release-label"><span class="std std-ref">RAJA Release Process</span></a> section.</p>

<h3>Gitflow Illustrated<a class="headerlink" href="#gitflow-illustrated" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The figure below shows the basics of how branches interact in Gitflow.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="id1">
<img alt="../../_images/git-workflow-gitflow2.png" src="../../_images/git-workflow-gitflow2.png" />
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">This figure shows typical interactions between key branches in the Gitflow
workflow. Here, development is shown following the v0.1.0 release. While
development was ongoing, a bug was found and a fix was needed to be made
available to users. A <em>hotfix</em> branch was made off of main and merged back
to main after the issue was addressed. Release v0.1.1 was tagged and main
was merged into develop so that it would not recur. Work started on a
feature branch before the v0.1.1 release and was merged into develop after
the v0.1.1 release. Then, a release candidate branch was made from develop.
The release was finalized on that branch after which it was merged into
main, and the v0.2.0 release was tagged. Finally, main was merged into
develop.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
